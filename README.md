 Projection, Lighting, and Shading in a WebGL Application
The goal of this project is to render a shape with lighting and shading and controllable sliders to change
variables of the location and size of the object, perspective vs orthogonal, location of the light, color of
the material, shininess of the material, and colour and intensity of the ambient light, specular light, and
diffuse light.
